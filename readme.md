## Getting Started

**First things first**

`git clone https://github.com/bradenhs/gossip-protocol.git`

After you've cloned the repo run

`npm install`

This ensures you have all the necessary dependencies to run the project.

After that it's simple! Just one more command:

`npm start`

And just like that you're gossip-protocolling.

## The code

Look in the `src` directory for the code. The `node.ts` file contains the main part of the algorithm.
